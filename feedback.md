## Final assignment 

### Comments:

- Documentation:
  - You have a very clear structure to your work and it's easy to follow. 
  - Nice that you added background info about the travel time matrix to the notebook.

- Analysis, visualizations & code: 
  - The grid folder and the grid shapefile were missing from the inputs. 
  - Also, the metro.shp and roads.shp were missing other files (.dbf, .shx) so they could not be displayed. 
  - There was some issues with the filepaths in the visualiser to get the files. 
  - You have clearly programming experience with other programming languages as some things are not done "the Python way", like using separate iterator variables. 
  - It would be a good idea to start every comment on their own row to improve readability.
  - It's great that you've modularised your code well into smaller helper functions. Every function has a good docstring and clarifying inline comments. 
  - accessviz could be further shaped into separate functions (eg TableJoiner()) using your smaller helper functions inside them. 
  - Big plus for creating an interactive user interface!
  - Pay attention to your commit messages (they could be more informative and in English)
